### GPG Keys

You can find my public key in this repo in the assets/ folder (or live at
tswedish.com/assets/tswedish_pub.asc). This key should
match my public key on keybase:

https://keybase.io/tswedish/pgp_keys.asc:

GPG key fingerprint: 8816 6879 65D2 9223 

Occassionally, I'll sign commits to this repo with the same key. It's easy to
verify on github or keybase.io/verify
