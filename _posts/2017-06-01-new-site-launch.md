I'm posting an update of my site today!

I've moved over to github pages, which uses [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) behind the scene to build a static HTML site from markdown files. In a future post I may cover how went about the migration, but for now feel free to check out the source on [github](https://github.com/tswedish/tswedish.github.io). Special thanks goes to the [post](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) by [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/), which this site basically comes from.
