>### OpenDR: Open Source Diabetic Retinopathy Screening

>{% include project-stub.md  

title="OpenDR" 

description="As part of my Master's thesis work, I created an organization dedicated to making AI to improve eye health. We built an open source API for Diabetic Retinopathy Grading, using the latest in deep learning and scalable web technologies to deliver an open platform that can automatically grade fundus images for DR severity."
