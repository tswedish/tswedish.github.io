{% include project-stub.md  

title="OpenDR: Open Source Diabetic Retinopathy Screening"

description="As part of my Master's thesis work, I created an organization dedicated to making AI to improve eye health. We built an open source API for Diabetic Retinopathy Grading, using the latest in deep learning and scalable web technologies to deliver an open platform that can automatically grade fundus images for DR severity."

{% include project-stub.md  

title="eyeSelfie: Self Directed Eye Alignment Using Reciprocal Eye Box Imaging"

description="Engineered light field patterns enabling self alignment to an imaging system that captures an image of the back of the eye. Images of the retina can be used to track health status over time or make screening more accessible at scale."

title="Domobi: Domestic Mobility for Cacti"

  description="Domobi is a robot I built based on the Willow Garage Turtlebot. The goal was to provide a mobile platform for a houseplant, specifically, my cactus. Domobi has a RGBD sensor and uses the turlebot ROS navigation stack to build a map using SLAM and planning motor actions to navigate my apartment."
